/*
We're going to build a small section of land just outside the city. A stretch of the beach, a fishing shack along it, a boat tied to the shore, and a lighthouse overlooking it all. This will cover several indoor and outdoor areas, as well as areas that offer you more possible details to work with, and others that may be a bit more barren.

The descriptions, at this time, should be static, and all objects in the room should have only two properties: a name and a description, unless @Blecki has more functionality prepared -- if so, we could try having a key and a locked door to the lighthouse. Otherwise, let's keep it simple.
